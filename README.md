# Capture Replay

## To run locally

```
npm install

Then open [`http://localhost:3030/`](http://localhost:3030/). This will open the UI application.

## To setup node server and mongo db

Create a new folder say "backend". Copy screenshots.model.js, server.js. Place package-mongo.json and rename it to package.json. 
```
npm install  (installs node server dependencies)
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon server  (to start node server)
mongod (starts mongo driver. Ensure mongoDB is installed on your system)
mongo (once the mongo client is started. It will prompt for database)
use screenshots (this will switch to screenshots DB that we have created)
```
## Test webservices using postman

Having completed the server implementation weâ€™re now ready to run tests for our HTTP endpoints by using the Postman tool (https://www.getpostman.com/).

## To capture the screenshots

UI application is running at port 3030, enter values and click next buttons. This will save the values in DB.

## To replay the screensots

Open replay.html in a browser. Enter a session id and clik "Play button". The stored screenshots will be replayed on the UI.
